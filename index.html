    <p1>This site is currently under construction with more to come!</p1>
    <p2>Hello! Korpcake Photography is a fictional business created for my IT371 course. This business is operated
        by myself, James Korp. I am an amateur photographer seeking to expand my skills and portfolio, as well
        learn a little about web design in the process. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like
        to schedule a shoot.
