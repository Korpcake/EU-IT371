<!-- Description of the site and business -->
    <p>Hello! Korpcake Photography is a fictional business created for my IT371 course. This business is operated
        by myself, James Korp. I am an amateur photographer seeking to expand my skills and portfolio, as well
        learn a little about web design in the process. Please reach out if you have any questions, would like
        to schedule a shoot, talk about web design, photography, or anything else!
    </p>
