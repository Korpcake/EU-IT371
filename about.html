    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        A little more about me and the business, I am a 36 year old husband, father, veteran, and student.
        My journey through school has been long and brought me to many interesting diciplines, the current being
        web design. I have a desire to grow these skills, and my skills in photography during this course and
        beyond.
